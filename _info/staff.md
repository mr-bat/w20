This is my first time tutoring for CS8 and I’m looking forward to getting to work with everyone in this class.  My goal is to help as many students as possible walk away feeling confident in their programming abilities.

  Major: Computer Science <br/>

  <i> "Hey everyone :) I’m a second year CS major. CS8 was my first CS class at UCSB and I remember being so afraid coming to class as a freshmen. I thought that everyone knew so much more than I did and I felt so intimidated. If you feel this way trust me you are not alone. With the help of great professors and tutors who helped me feel welcome I improved so much in my abilities and gained a lot of confidence. I’m excited to be a tutor because I want to do the same and make you realize how interesting and rewarding coding is. I know that the course is fast paced and in moments you might feel extremely overwhelmed, but I, along with an amazing staff of TA’s, tutors, and a stellar professor, am more than eager to help. I want to share some tricks that I found helpful when taking CS8 and help you see that you can do it. I know that people think of CS as being extremely difficult and stressful, but I want to help you see how fun it can actually be. In addition to the Python you learn in this class, feel free to reach out to me and ask about C++, Java, or Mathematica and I will do my best to answer any questions that you have. Also, If you have any questions in regards to course material, study methods, tips I have for being successful in this class, or if you just want to talk feel free to reach out to me. I’m a super friendly and social person and am always open to conversation. Outside of school I love playing volleyball and play for the UCSB women’s club volleyball team so you might see me on the beach courts over the weekends. Other than volleyball I love to paint (although I am not the best at it) and I love to travel. I look forward to meeting you all and I hope that this quarter will be an awesome experience.

    Previous experience as a TA: This is my first time TAing CS8.<br/>
  <i> "Hi everyone! I'm a first year PhD student, and my areas of interest are Machine Learning, HCI and Affective Computing. Computer programming was something I had a hard time understanding initially, and I've realised how important it is to have someone who can explain (multiple times, as is often necessary) all of the ideas and concepts that seem super intimidating (until you get to the point where you realize they were a lot simpler than they seemed). I hope to be able to help all of you find out just how fun programming can be, this quarter! When I'm not working I can be found reading, listening to music, baking, travelling, and attempting (usually unsuccessfully) to learn new languages." </i>

<i>Hello! I’m Olivia (she/her/hers) and I am a first year CS major. Although I don’t have an extensive background in CS, I will help in the ways that I can! I took CS8 just last quarter, so the material should hopefully still be fresh in my mind. I will answer questions on Piazza and questions you have during lab hours. If I cannot answer a question, I will direct you to someone who can! 

People come into CS8 with very different backgrounds in coding, some with quite a lot, some with none. It can be intimidating when people are finishing labs before you’ve even finished reading the instructions. I hope that when you guys are struggling, you are not afraid to ask for help, or if you are afraid, you ask for help anyway. We are here to help (not judge) and we’ve all struggled at some point, too. Last quarter, after spending more than 45 minutes on the first lab, I was made aware (by Prof K) that I was still logged into the previous user’s account. I had to redo the lab, but thankfully it went much faster the second time.

Some other things about me: I am a member of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), so feel free to ask me questions about that. In my free time I like to be outdoors. I often rollerblade to and from class, and I go to the beach most days of the week. I like to climb trees and go indoor rock climbing. I used to sail and hopefully will start sailing again during some future quarter at UCSB. I like board games (like one-night Werewolf) and card games (like Egyptian War). Feel free to contact me on Piazza.</i>
